===================   TASK 3   ====================
* Name: Cube Volume
*
* Write a function `cube_volume` that will return
* volume of a cube for a given side length.
* If passed value is invalid, function should
* return -1 which indicates something went wrong.
*
* Note: Please describe in details possible cases
* in which your solution might not work.
*
* Use main() function to test your solution.
